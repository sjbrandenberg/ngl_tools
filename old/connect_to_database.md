## Installing Database Connection Script
 
Connecting to a relational database requires credentials, like username, password, database name, and hostname. 
Rather than requiring users to know these credentials, we have created a Python package that allows users to 
connect to the database. This code installs the package containing the database connection script for NGL:

```python
!pip install git+https://github.com/sjbrandenberg/designsafe_db
```
